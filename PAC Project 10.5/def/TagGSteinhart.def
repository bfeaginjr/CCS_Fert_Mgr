This file contains predefined Steinhat-Hart coefficients for thermistor curves
used by the SNAP-AIR400K module. 

The module uses the Steinhart-Hart equation
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinhart%E2%80%93Hart_equation) to determine
what temperature a thermistor's resistance indicates. The user is free to use
any coefficients they like, we simply include coefficients for some common
thermistor curves.

The module actually uses the more general form of the equation described at
Wikipedia, including an (ln(R))^2 term as the coefficient named K. The full
equation we use is:
  A + B(ln(R)) + K(ln(R))^2 + C(ln(R))^3

The lines above are formatted as following:
A; B; K; C; Name

Where A, B, K, and C are the coefficients for the above equation, and Name is
the name used in the Thermistor curve dropdown menu.
